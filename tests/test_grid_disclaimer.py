"""M-4 regression: grid optimisation output must carry a prominent in-sample /
selection-bias disclaimer steering users toward walk-forward.

Unlike walk-forward, the grid table reports best-of-grid IN-SAMPLE metrics, so
the headline Sharpe is optimistically biased. The disclaimer must make that
explicit so the figure is not mistaken for an out-of-sample estimate.
