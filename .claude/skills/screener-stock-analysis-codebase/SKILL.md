# Screener Stock Analysis Codebase

Use this skill for codebase-backed stock analysis, portfolio reviews, signal checks, strategy research, and comparisons between the Python and Rust implementations in this workspace.

## Workspace Map

- `screener/`: primary Python CLI and research code. Use `uv` from this directory.
- `screener_bot/`: Telegram bot that wraps the Python `screener` package for portfolio checks, alerts, charts, and scheduled screen diffs.
- `screener-rs/`: Rust migration and parity/performance implementation. Use Cargo from this directory.

If repo guidance conflicts, follow `screener/AGENTS.md`: use `uv`; bot code lives in `../screener_bot/`. The root instruction references `RTK.md`, but this workspace currently does not contain that file.

## First Choice Tooling

Use the Python CLI for complete stock-analysis workflows because it has the richest feature surface and tests:

```bash
cd screener
uv run screener --help
uv run screener screen -m us -c ema -n 30
uv run screener screen -m india -c breakout -n 30 --detail
uv run screener rs-breakout -m india -n 50
uv run screener unusual-volume -m us --tickers AAPL,MSFT
uv run screener promoter-buys -m india --min-change 0.5
uv run screener garp -m us --universe-size 300 --workers 8
uv run screener backtest-rolling -m us --years 2 --strategy rs_breakout --top 10
```

Use Rust when the task is parity, speed, CLI migration, or checking behavior against the migration target:

```bash
cd screener-rs
cargo run -- screen -m us -c ema -n 30
cargo run -- rs-breakout -m india -n 50
cargo run -- backtest-rolling -m us --years 2 --strategy rs_breakout --top 10
cargo test
```

Use the bot project when the task involves Telegram command behavior, portfolio alerting, scheduled screener messages, chart rendering, authorization, or Turso-backed portfolio state:

```bash
cd screener_bot
uv run python -m screener_bot
uv run pytest
```

## Data Source Rules

- Prefer existing repo providers and caches before writing ad hoc network code.
- Use TradingView scanner data for broad technical universes in `screen`.
- Use yfinance-backed OHLCV through `screener.backtester.data.build_price_fetcher()` for time-series analysis.
- Use FMP only when `FMP_API_KEY` is present, mostly for US insider/fundamental/event context.
- Use screener.in / openscreener for Indian fundamentals and promoter/shareholding context.
- Use NSE cash/F&O bhavcopy and option-chain helpers for India delivery, operator intent, and unusual-volume overlays.
- When giving current stock advice, verify the latest available data timestamp and state it. Do not invent fundamentals, analyst targets, earnings dates, or promoter changes.
- Treat stale, missing, or conflicting data as an analysis finding, not a reason to fill gaps from memory.

## Python Analysis Paths

Use these modules instead of recreating logic:

- Technical screen: `screener/screener/commands/screen.py`, `screener/screener/scanner.py`, `screener/screener/criteria/plugins/`.
- Custom criteria: add a plugin in `screener/screener/criteria/plugins/` with `@criterion("name")`; use `pipeline=True` only when the scan needs enrichment/history/external providers.
- Backtests: `screener/screener/backtester/historical.py`, `rolling.py`, `core.py`, `models.py`, `metrics.py`.
- Price data: `screener/screener/backtester/data.py`; use `tv_to_yf()` for symbol mapping and injected `PriceFetcher` for tests.
- Pine-like expressions: `screener/screener/backtester/pine.py`.
- Named strategies: `screener/screener/strategies/plugins/` with `@strategy(...)`; expressions flow through `screener/strategies/expressions.py`.
- GARP: `screener/screener/garp.py` and `screener/screener/commands/garp.py`.
- Promoter/insider buys: `screener/screener/insiders.py` and `screener/screener/commands/insiders.py`.
- Relative-strength breakout: `screener/screener/rs_breakout.py` and `screener/screener/commands/rs_breakout.py`.
- Unusual volume: `screener/screener/unusual_volume/`.
- Operator scan: `screener/screener/operator/`.
- Optimization: `screener/screener/backtester/optimization/`.

For quick per-symbol technical detail, it is often easier to import bot logic:

```python
from screener_bot.technical import TechnicalService
```

but remember `screener_bot` normally depends on bot config and portfolio objects, so CLI/import scripts in `screener/` are cleaner for one-off research.

## Rust Analysis Paths

Rust mirrors many Python concepts but is not just a wrapper:

- CLI entrypoint and command wiring: `screener-rs/src/main.rs`.
- Backtest engine and rolling/historical simulation: `screener-rs/src/backtester/engine.rs`.
- Data models: `screener-rs/src/backtester/models.rs`, `screener-rs/src/data.rs`.
- Pine expression evaluator: `screener-rs/src/pine.rs`.
- Providers: `screener-rs/src/providers/` for Yahoo, TradingView, NSE, screener.in, cache, resilience, fundamentals.
- Screeners: `screener-rs/src/screeners/`.
- Criteria parity files: `screener-rs/src/screeners/criteria/`.
- Parity tests: `screener-rs/tests/parity.rs`, `parity_test.rs`.

Rust config intentionally supports YAML strategy and criteria aliases through `strategies:` and `criteria:`. JSON config support is intentionally not part of the migration.

## Recommended Stock Analysis Workflow

1. Normalize the input:
   - US symbols: `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `SPY`.
   - India symbols: prefer `NSE:RELIANCE` or plain `RELIANCE` with `market=india`; `tv_to_yf()` maps to `.NS`.
   - Portfolio entries may include entry price, market value, timeframe, and risk style.
2. Pull current/recent OHLCV through repo providers and record the last bar date.
3. Run a technical pass:
   - Trend: EMA/SMA 20/50/200 alignment.
   - Momentum: RSI, price change, relative strength versus `SPY` for US or `^NSEI` for India.
   - Risk: ATR, recent swing lows/highs, gap risk, volume/liquidity.
   - Confirmation: breakout, unusual volume, delivery, SuperTrend, operator labels when relevant.
4. Run a fundamental/context pass:
   - GARP / quality / valuation when available.
   - Promoter/insider/ownership changes where supported.
   - Earnings or event risk if discoverable from repo providers or verified external sources.
5. Use backtests for strategy claims:
   - Prefer `backtest-rolling` for live-like selection behavior.
   - Use `backtest-historical` for point-in-time candidate checks.
   - Use `vbt-sweep` for fast triage only; validate promising ideas with rolling backtests.
   - Include slippage, commission, liquidity filters, benchmark, and clear start/end dates.
6. Convert evidence into action levels only after the above:
   - Close-based stop.
   - Hard invalidation stop.
   - TP1/TP2 or trim zones.
   - Add/reclaim level if setup is not yet confirmed.

## Best Practices And Pitfalls

- Do not bypass the registries. Add criteria under `criteria/plugins/` and strategies under `strategies/plugins/`.
- Keep data loading separate from signal math so tests can use stub price fetchers.
- Avoid lookahead. For volume averages and rolling highs/lows, use prior-bar baselines when the code already does so.
- Prefer CSV/JSON/Markdown output flags for repeatable analysis artifacts.
- Use `--refresh` only when cache freshness matters; otherwise respect cache TTLs.
- Use global Click options before subcommands: `uv run screener --log-level ERROR screen ...`.
- For India analysis, distinguish NSE cash delivery, F&O OI, promoter shareholding, and yfinance data; they answer different questions.
- For US insider buys, FMP Form 4 data is better when configured; yfinance is fallback context.
- For current financial facts, browse or use live providers when there is any chance the answer changed recently.
- Always state uncertainty: stale prices, missing FMP key, unavailable promoter table, failed provider, or thin liquidity.

## Validation

Python:

```bash
cd screener
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check $(git ls-files '*.py')
uv run ruff format --check $(git ls-files '*.py')
uv run mypy
```

Bot:

```bash
cd screener_bot
uv run pytest
uv run ruff check $(git ls-files '*.py')
uv run mypy
```

Rust:

```bash
cd screener-rs
cargo test
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features
```

For parity-sensitive changes, run both Python and Rust on the same explicit tickers, dates, strategy, and offline CSV if possible.

## Output Standard

For analysis responses, include:

- Data date/time and sources.
- Market, ticker normalization, and commands or modules used.
- A concise table of signals or holdings.
- Short reasoning for each symbol.
- Risk levels and invalidation logic when asked for trading decisions.
- A clear note when the output is research, not financial advice.

Do not present a screen or backtest as a recommendation without explaining assumptions, data freshness, and the main failure modes.
